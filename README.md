This is the GitHub repository for Self-Drive Slot Cars - a project that simulates how self-driving vehicles can sense the world around them.

## About the project
The original idea for this was that we could turn a standard two-player track into a one-player track, where the human can race the computer. This project uses a standard [Scalextric](https://www.scalextric.com/uk-en/) set and a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero-w/) to run the automatic car. The Pi runs a Python script, along with machine learning libraries, to determine its location on the track and control the speed dynamically based on this by controlling the current delivered to the car's motor. This means that the car will be able to automatically speed up for straights and slow down on corners, meaning that it won't fall off the track.

Our intention is to set parameters meaning that the car will finish the race in a certain time, and the human must attempt to beat the computer to win.

## Future plans
In the future, this could be used as a simulation of how self-driving electric vehicles function in the real world. It shows how the vehicle will be able to use sensors to determine its location and make real-time calculations that will aid in collision avoidance.

## The team
The project team is made up of 3 people:
- [Edward Suckling](https://github.com/edwards070)

- [Luke Tainton](https://github.com/luketainton)
